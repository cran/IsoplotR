\details{
Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) is a dimension-reducting technique
that takes a matrix of pairwise `dissimilarities' between objects
(e.g., age distributions) as input and produces a configuration of
two (or higher-) dimensional coordinates as output, so that the
Euclidean distances between these coordinates approximate the
dissimilarities of the input matrix. Thus, an MDS-configuration
serves as a `map' in which similar samples cluster closely together
and dissimilar samples plot far apart. In the context of detrital
geochronology, the dissimilarity between samples is given by the
statistical distance between age distributions. There are many ways
to define this statistical distance. \code{IsoplotR} uses the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic due to its simplicity and the
fact that it behaves like a true distance in the mathematical sense
of the word (Vermeesch, 2013). The KS-distance is given by the
maximum vertical distance between two \code{\link{cad}} step
functions. Thus, the KS-distance takes on values between zero
(perfect match between two age distributions) and one (no overlap
between two distributions).  Calculating the KS-distance between
samples two at a time populates a symmetric dissimilarity matrix
with positive values and a zero diagonal. \code{IsoplotR}
implements two algorithms to convert this matrix into a
configuration. The first (`classical') approach uses a sequence of
basic matrix manipulations developed by Young and Householder
(1938) and Torgerson (1952) to achieve a linear fit between the
KS-distances and the fitted distances on the MDS configuration. The
second, more sophisticated (`nonmetric') approach subjects the
input distances to a transformation \eqn{f} prior to fitting a
configuration:
\cr\cr
\eqn{\delta_{i,j} = f(KS_{i,j})}
\cr\cr
where \eqn{KS_{i,j}} is the KS-distance between samples \eqn{i} and
\eqn{j} (for \eqn{1 \leq i \neq j \leq n}) and \eqn{\delta_{i,j}}
is the `disparity' (Kruskal, 1964).  Fitting an MDS
configuration then involves finding the disparity transformation
that maximises the goodness of fit (or minimises the `stress')
between the disparities and the fitted distances. The latter two
quantities can also be plotted against each other as a `Shepard
plot'.
