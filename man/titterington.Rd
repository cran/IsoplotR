\title{Linear regression of X,Y,Z-variables with correlated errors}
\usage{
titterington(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an \code{[nx9]} matrix with the following columns:
\code{X, sX,} \code{Y, sY,} \code{Z, sZ}, \code{rXY,}
\code{rXZ,} \code{rYZ}.}
}
\value{
A four-element list of vectors containing:

    \describe{
    \item{par}{4-element vector \code{c(a,b,A,B)} where \code{a} is
              the intercept of the \code{X-Y} regression, \code{b}
              is the slope of the \code{X-Y} regression, \code{A}
              is the intercept of the \code{X-Z} regression, and
              \code{B} is the slope of the \code{X-Z} regression.}

    \item{cov}{\code{[4x4]}-element covariance matrix of \code{par}}

    \item{mswd}{the mean square of the residuals (a.k.a `reduced
                Chi-square') statistic}

    \item{p.value}{p-value of a Chi-square test for linearity}

    \item{df}{the number of degrees of freedom for the
              Chi-square test (2\eqn{n}-4)}

    \item{tfact}{the \eqn{100(1-\alpha/2)\%} percentile of the
                 t-distribution with \eqn{(n-2k+1)} degrees of freedom}
}
}
\description{
Implements the maximum likelihood algorithm of Ludwig and
Titterington (1994) for linear regression of three dimensional data
with correlated uncertainties.
}
\details{
Ludwig and Titterington (1994)'s 3-dimensional linear regression
algorithm for data with correlated uncertainties is an extension of
the 2-dimensional algorithm by Titterington and Halliday (1979),
which itself is equivalent to the algorithm of York et al. (2004).
Given \eqn{n} triplets of (approximately) collinear measurements
\eqn{X_i}, \eqn{Y_i} and \eqn{Z_i} (for \eqn{1 \leq i \leq n}),
their uncertainties \eqn{s[X_i]}, \eqn{s[Y_i]} and \eqn{s[Z_i]},
and their covariances cov[\eqn{X_i,Y_i}], cov[\eqn{X_i,Z_i}] and
cov[\eqn{Y_i,Z_i}], the \code{titterington} function fits two
slopes and intercepts with their uncertainties. It computes the
MSWD as a measure of under/overdispersion.  Overdispersed datasets
(MSWD>1) can be dealt with in the same three ways that are
described in the documentation of the \code{\link{isochron}}
function.
